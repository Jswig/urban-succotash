I am a data professional with experience across the stack. I am currently a data scientist and engineer at [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/).
Prior to that, I did research on generative models for genotypes at the 
[UCSC Genomics Institute](https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), 
and on containerizing computational research workflows at the 
[Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu/).
