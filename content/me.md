I am a data scientist and engineer at 
[Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/), which is working to make electrified air
transport accessible to all. Before that, I worked on sleep trackers at 
[Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/home/business).
I also did research on generative models for genotypes at the 
[UCSC Genomics Institute](https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), 
and on the use of containers to improve the replicability of computational research at 
the [Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu/).
