I am currently a data scientist at [Joby Aviation](https://www.jobyaviation.com/), which is working to make electified 
air transport accessible to all.
Before that, I worked on sleep trackers at [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/home/business).
I also did research on generative models for genotypes at the 
[UCSC Genomics Institute](https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), 
and on container technology for improving the replicability of computational research at the 
[Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu/).
